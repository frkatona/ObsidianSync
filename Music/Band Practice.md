###  Discussion
- Meeting schedule
	- Steve is unavailable for Mondays due to another band practice, but says Wednesdays are free
	- Seana and Anthony can make Wednesdays, but Cynthia needs to check her calendar to be sure 
	- Possible daytime practice with Anthony and Cynthia (Anthony will send Cynthia his availability asap)
- We will try out beginning play sessions with songs from the references playlists chosen to acclimate to the tone of the songs we're practices
	- Seana suggests "Sun comes up, it's Tuesday morning"
	- Today we'll play "Beautiful Feeling" to lead into Feeling Muse (https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pj-harvey/beautiful-feeling-chords-4731104)
- Some songs may be interesting as a duet between Seana and Anthony (specifics tbd)
- Song edits
	- Feeling Muse
		- play verse 3 softly
		- Cynthia will try to come up with a bass intro for a few bars to lead the intro
- A show was offered for October, but the consensus seems to be that October is too soon to accept
	- Cynthia may be comfortable with some songs by November, but January is preferred to give her time to implement what she's learned and for us to play it together
	- Seana would be comfortable playing with a trimmed-down version of the band if she accepted a show on too short of notice for Cynthia to feel prepared  
### Next practice

- Time? (7:00 to 9:30 PM again?  earlier start?)
- Songs?
- Food plans?
