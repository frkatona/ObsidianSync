### Attendees
- Seana
- Cynthia
- Anthony
### Time
- start: 5:00
- end: 6:30
### Agenda
- Practice
	- Feeling Muse (warmup: PJ Harvey - This is Love)
	- Hoi Polloi (warmup: Cowboy Junkies - Sweet Jane)
	- 4am (warmup: Indigo Girls - Closer to Fine)
### Previous business
- n/a
###  Discussion
- Vocal range estimation
	- Seana - B2 to G5
	- Cynthia C3 to G5
- Changes need to be made to the files online:
	- the last verse in Hoi Polloi should be {p}
	- verse 3 in Feeling Muse should be {p}
		- this was noted at last practice, but missed
- Homework
	- Anthony
		- update the website material (mentioned above)
		- try Cynthia's Maestro-exported MIDI file for Feeling Muse bass
		- Cynthia wanted Anthony to try to re-evaluate if a triple meter could be more appropriate for Feeling Muse 
	- Cynthia
		- continue working on integrating the bass runs she had worked on the last week
		- update the group when she can verify her schedule for next week's practice 
	- Seana
		- Anthony thought down the intensities of this Hoi Polloi version was inconsistent with other versions, so he's asking Seana to write down her intended intensities, or otherwise verify that the intensities reflected in some specific existing recording match the ideal vision 
		- Anthony was hoping that the 'warmup' cover song exercise would be more directed at articulable character in the proposed songs, so he's asking Seana to listen to whichever 3 songs she'd prefer this week and write down what specific character she hopes to emulate from each
			- e.g., weight (breathy/intimate, belty, silky etc.), power (intense, dynamic), resonance/placement (nasally, throaty, twangy, husky, chesty, warm/rich, etc.),  skillful (runs, glides, range, or vibrato), dramatic phrasing, relaxed delivery, expressive (raw/vulnerable, whiny, meek, proud, submissive), talk-sing articulation, crisp/percussive, soulful, ethereal, pacing
		- Report to the group if the same three warmup cover songs (This is Love, Sweet Jane, Closer to Fine) have the character she's looking for or what new three songs would be better
		- Think on what needs to change about Hoi Polloi before Cynthia can be given directions on harmonizing
### Next practice
- Tentatively next Wednesday
	- possibly early evening start time (~4:30, 5:00 PM)
- Songs
	- Same 3 (Feeling Muse, Hoi Polloi, 4am)
- Food plans
	- TBD, but ideal if Seana will be coming straight from work. Discuss more this week
- Other participants - Sid and Mike considering joining next Wednesday.  Steve unknown

###  Discussion
- Meeting schedule
	- Steve is unavailable for Mondays due to another band practice, but says Wednesdays are free
	- Seana and Anthony can make Wednesdays, but Cynthia needs to check her calendar to be sure 
	- Possible daytime practice with Anthony and Cynthia (Anthony will send Cynthia his availability asap)
- We will try out beginning play sessions with songs from the references playlists chosen to acclimate to the tone of the songs we're practices
	- Seana suggests "Sun comes up, it's Tuesday morning"
	- Today we'll play "Beautiful Feeling" to lead into Feeling Muse (https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pj-harvey/beautiful-feeling-chords-4731104)
- Some songs may be interesting as a duet between Seana and Anthony (specifics tbd)
- Song edits
	- Feeling Muse
		- play verse 3 softly
		- Cynthia will try to come up with a bass intro for a few bars to lead the intro
- A show was offered for October, but the consensus seems to be that October is too soon to accept
	- Cynthia may be comfortable with some songs by November, but January is preferred to give her time to implement what she's learned and for us to play it together
	- Seana would be comfortable playing with a trimmed-down version of the band if she accepted a show on too short of notice for Cynthia to feel prepared  
### Next practice
- Tentatively next Wednesday (2025-09-10) at Anthony's place in Lemont
- Time? (7:00 to 9:30 PM again?  earlier start?)
- Songs?
- Food plans?
