### 9/1/2025 Recording Session
- Feeling Muse
	- chorus rhythms
- 4am
	- started using pop filter for plosives and consistent distances
	- fully off-book this session with fisty gesturing, feels more organic/emotive
	- take 1
		- went back to start from fill before chorus (measure 24)
		- verse 2+ a little try-hard with the breathiness --> not much body
		- went back to end of instrumental, doubled back again to bar ~87.1
		- went back to end of chorus 3 (bar 123)
		- ultimately a wash for unnatural over-performing
	- take 2
		- went back to bar 40
		- chorus 2 shakey on pitch, but good character (see if it's newtone0salvageable)
		- went forward to bar 87
		- choruses sometimes still rhythmically shakey at the end, imagine that hit for the rest (e.g., ~121) 
	- separate takes
		- verse 2 (vox v7) maybe too chesty in the first half (according to Seana)
### 8/30/2025 Recording Session
- Feeling Muse
	- turned down to 150 BPM (from 160 BPM)
	- pitch iffy in some choruses (check against vocoder)
	- take 3
		- chorus rhythms
		- verse growls atonal and shakey
		- verse 3 rhythm and pitch
		- outro intervals solid
- 4am
	- figuring out chorus opening melody ("while in free fall" - maybe straight Ds, maybe D, C#, E, D)
