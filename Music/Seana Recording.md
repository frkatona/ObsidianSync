## 9/6/2025 Mixing Notes
- Feeling Muse
	- General
		- Add bass intro?  Want to wait for Cynthia or for me to throw something together?
		- Want the fake bass in?
	- 0:05 - "me" rocky low end
	- 1:15 - "A thousand kisses" rushed
	- 0:29 - chorus starts a little rushed
	- 0:49 - "destiny" s sound
	- 0:58 - "enemy" low end rocky
	- 1:04 - try to get more excited by the end of chorus
	- 1:17 - a little too insincere in the sultry "happy birthday mr president" voice
	- 1:30 - "this other thing" kinda bored
	- 1:45 - "explode" shakey
	- 1:55 - "fools" pitch correct?
	- 2:00 - "wake" more emotion? same with "take" in next line?
	- 2:15 - "explode" shakey
- 4am
	- General
		- with or without bass?
	- 0:30 - "whole" sounds good, but could it get even growlier?
	- 1:14 - "11 AM" pitch unclear, little shakey
	- 1:24 - "in" pitch unclear
	- 1:35 - "scream a little, in the end" pitch shakey
	- 1:58 - "behind"
	- 2:04 - a little pitchy with "gonna hide away"
	- 3:22 - "behind"
	- 3:42 - "without" a bitter under-enunciated

### 9/1/2025 Recording Session
- Feeling Muse
	- chorus rhythms
- 4am
	- started using pop filter for plosives and consistent distances
	- fully off-book this session with fisty gesturing, feels more organic/emotive
	- take 1
		- went back to start from fill before chorus (measure 24)
		- verse 2+ a little try-hard with the breathiness --> not much body
		- went back to end of instrumental, doubled back again to bar ~87.1
		- went back to end of chorus 3 (bar 123)
		- ultimately a wash for unnatural over-performing
	- take 2
		- went back to bar 40
		- chorus 2 shakey on pitch, but good character (see if it's newtone-salvageable)
		- went forward to bar 87
		- choruses sometimes still rhythmically shakey at the end, imagine that hit for the rest (e.g., ~121) 
	- separate takes
		- verse 2 (vox v7) maybe too chesty in the first half (according to Seana)
### 8/30/2025 Recording Session
- Feeling Muse
	- turned down to 150 BPM (from 160 BPM)
	- pitch iffy in some choruses (check against vocoder)
	- take 3
		- chorus rhythms
		- verse growls atonal and shakey
		- verse 3 rhythm and pitch
		- outro intervals solid
- 4am
	- figuring out chorus opening melody ("while in free fall" - maybe straight Ds, maybe D, C#, E, D)
