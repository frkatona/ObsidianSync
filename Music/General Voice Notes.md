## Errors and coaching
### 1. **Breath and Support Issues**
- shallow, chest-only breathing
	- emphasize diaphragmatic/low breathing (lie on your back and feel your stomach rise)
- running out of air too soon
	- hiss to learn airflow control
- forcing air out ("pushing") instead of a controlled release
	- imagery: "sip air low into the belly," "inflate like a tire at the bottom, not the top"
### 2. **Tension in the Body**
- tight jaw or raised shoulder
	- jaw release exercises (gentle massage, dropping jaw silently)
- “choked” or strained sound on high notes
	- tongue trills or lip trills — removes throat tension
- visible neck tension while sustaining notes
	- posture reset: tall spine, shoulders down, relaxed face
	- imagery: "yawn space" or "sing through a smile" to encourage openness
### 3. **Pitch Accuracy**
- Singing flat (usually from poor support or heavy chest)
	- Ear training with piano/guitar reference
- Singing sharp (often from excess tension or pushing)
	- Slow scale work, sustaining notes before moving up or down
- “Sliding” unintentionally between notes
	- Mental trick: for flatness → “think higher/lighter”; for sharpness → “relax and aim lower
### 4. **Register Breaks**
- Sudden cracks between chest and head voice
	- Sirens (gliding from low to high on “ng” or “oo”) to smooth passaggio
- Forcing chest voice too high
	- Work in middle mix register with small steps, not leaps
- Weak falsetto with no connection to other registers
	- Strengthen falsetto/head gradually so it blends with chest
### 5. **Tone & Resonance Imbalances**
- Too nasally (over-bright, squeezed)
    - Nasal fix: add more open mouth space, “lift” the soft palate (yawn sensation)
- Too swallowed (muffled, “stuck in the throat”)
    - Swallowed fix: brighten vowels forward into mask resonance
- Monotone, lacking color or variation
    - Encourage vowel modification (open _ah_ → _uh_ as notes rise)
    - Record playback — hearing imbalance is often half the fix
### 6. **Articulation & Diction Problems**
- Words unclear, muddled consonants
    - Practice text as spoken monologue, then add melody
- Over-enunciating so it distorts line
    - Use exaggerated tongue twisters for agility
    - Sing vowels smoothly, speak consonants crisply
### 7. **Stylistic & Expressive Missteps**
- Overuse of vibrato, riffs, or belting
    - Limit vibrato/melisma until technique is solid
- Singing everything at one volume
    - Assign dynamic exercises: sing a phrase from pianissimo → fortissimo
- Mimicking a favorite artist instead of finding own voice
    - Encourage self-listening and recording to develop authentic style
### 8. **General Over-singing / Fatigue**
- Pushing volume instead of using resonance
    - Focus on resonance placement (“let the sound ring forward”) instead of brute force
- Hoarseness after short singing session
    - Teach pacing: short practice sessions with rests
    - Hydration and vocal health (steam, warm-ups, no shouting)

### Exercise Sounds and Their Uses
- - **“NG” (as in _sing_)**
    - Promotes head resonance (mask vibration).
    - Helps close soft palate, reduce throat tension.
    - Common for sirens/slides to connect registers smoothly.
- **“OO” (as in _food_)**
    - Narrows the vocal tract, encouraging head voice and upper register.
    - Stabilizes pitch in passaggio.
    - Can reduce breathiness by encouraging rounded lips.
- **“AH” (as in _father_)**
    - Open vowel, chest-friendly.
    - Good for resonance and projection work.
    - Can expose tension issues if the throat is tight.
- **“EE” (as in _see_)**
    - Bright, forward vowel that promotes mask resonance.
    - Useful for intonation training (easy to hear pitch center).
    - Can become nasal if overdone.
- **“EH / AY” (as in _bed_ / _say_)**
    - Transitional vowels — useful for smoothing between “AH” and “EE.”
    - Common in vowel modification for higher pitches (e.g., “AH” shifting toward “UH” or “EH”).
- **Lip trills / tongue trills (brrrr / rrrr)**
    - Release excess tension.
    - Let the folds vibrate freely without forcing.
    - Great warm-ups for breath flow and endurance.
- **Humming (“mm”)**
    - Encourages forward placement and resonance.
    - Gentle vocal fold closure.
    - Safe for cool-downs.

- Closed vowels (oo, ee, ng) -> stabilize head voice and smooth transitions
- Open vowels (ah, eh, oh) -> build power, resonance, and projections
- Semi-occluded sounds (trills, humming, straw phonation) -> release tension, improve efficiency

			- focus on "ey" vowel in the word "take"
		- example at 5:37
