# Errors and coaching
### 1. **Breath and Support Issues**
- shallow, chest-only breathing
	- emphasize diaphragmatic/low breathing (lie on your back and feel your stomach rise)
	- imagery: "sip air low into the belly," "inflate like a tire at the bottom, not the top"
- running out of air too soon
	- hiss to learn airflow control
- forcing air out ("pushing") instead of a controlled release
### 2. **Tension in the Body**
- tight jaw or raised shoulder
	- jaw release exercises (gentle massage, dropping jaw silently)
- “choked” or strained sound on high notes
	- tongue trills or lip trills — removes throat tension
- visible neck tension while sustaining notes
	- posture reset: tall spine, shoulders down, relaxed face
	- imagery: "yawn space" or "sing through a smile" to encourage openness
### 3. **Pitch Accuracy**
- Singing flat (usually from poor support or heavy chest)
	- Ear training with piano/guitar reference
- Singing sharp (often from excess tension or pushing)
	- Slow scale work, sustaining notes before moving up or down
- “Sliding” unintentionally between notes
	- Mental trick: for flatness → “think higher/lighter”; for sharpness → “relax and aim lower"
### 4. **Register Breaks**
- Sudden cracks between chest and head voice
	- Sirens (gliding from low to high on “ng” or “oo”) to smooth passaggio
- Forcing chest voice too high
	- Work in middle mix register with small steps, not leaps
- Weak falsetto with no connection to other registers
	- Strengthen falsetto/head gradually so it blends with chest
### 5. **Tone & Resonance Imbalances**
- Too nasally (over-bright, squeezed)
    - Nasal fix: add more open mouth space, “lift” the soft palate (yawn sensation)
- Too swallowed (muffled, “stuck in the throat”)
    - Swallowed fix: brighten vowels forward into mask resonance
- Monotone, lacking color or variation
    - Encourage vowel modification (open _ah_ → _uh_ as notes rise)
    - Record playback — hearing imbalance is often half the fix
### 6. **Articulation & Diction Problems**
- Words unclear, muddled consonants
    - Practice text as spoken monologue, then add melody
- Over-enunciating so it distorts line
    - Use exaggerated tongue twisters for agility
    - Sing vowels smoothly, speak consonants crisply
### 7. **Stylistic & Expressive Missteps**
- Overuse of vibrato, riffs, or belting
    - Limit vibrato/melisma until technique is solid
- Singing everything at one volume
    - Assign dynamic exercises: sing a phrase from pianissimo → fortissimo
- Mimicking a favorite artist instead of finding own voice
    - Encourage self-listening and recording to develop authentic style
### 8. **General Over-singing / Fatigue**
- Pushing volume instead of using resonance
    - Focus on resonance placement (“let the sound ring forward”) instead of brute force
- Hoarseness after short singing session
    - Teach pacing: short practice sessions with rests
    - Hydration and vocal health (steam, warm-ups, no shouting)

### Exercise Sounds and Their Uses
- - **“NG” (as in _sing_)**
    - Promotes HEAD resonance (mask vibration).
    - Helps close soft palate, reduce throat tension.
    - Common for sirens/slides to connect registers smoothly.
- **“OO” (as in _food_)**
    - Narrows the vocal tract, encouraging HEAD voice and upper register.
    - Stabilizes pitch in passaggio.
    - Can reduce breathiness by encouraging rounded lips.
- **“AH” (as in _father_)**
    - Open vowel, CHEST-friendly.
    - Good for resonance and projection work.
    - Can expose tension issues if the throat is tight.
- **“EE” (as in _see_)**
    - Bright, forward vowel that promotes MASK resonance.
    - Useful for intonation training (easy to hear pitch center).
    - Can become nasal if overdone.
- **“EH / AY” (as in _bed_ / _say_)**
    - TRANSITIONAL vowels — useful for smoothing between “AH” and “EE.”
    - Common in vowel modification for higher pitches (e.g., “AH” shifting toward “UH” or “EH”).
- **Lip trills / tongue trills (brrrr / rrrr)**
    - Release excess tension.
    - Let the folds vibrate freely without forcing.
    - Great warm-ups for breath flow and endurance.
- **Humming (“mm”)**
    - Encourages forward placement and resonance.
    - Gentle vocal fold closure.
    - Safe for cool-downs.

- Closed vowels (oo, ee, ng) -> stabilize HEAD voice and smooth TRANSITIONS
- Open vowels (ah, eh, oh) -> build power, resonance, and projections
- Semi-occluded sounds (trills, humming, straw phonation, z/v) -> release tension, find resonance while folds are cushioned by neutral pressure

[Support article](https://completesingers.com/technique/how-do-i-breathe-what-is-support/)
"""
our breathing and support system can only be accessed if your posture is correct.  This means:

1. The back of the neck must be tall (as if you were being slightly suspended from the roof with a string attached to the back of your head)
2. The chin, however, must not tuck itself into the neck. This will depress the larnyx.
3. The chest must be out, but not puffed out. Think of your collar bone being a lot wider than you think it is.
4. The pelvis should be tucked slightly forward. Always make sure you are doing this when you are keeping your chest broad and wide.
5. The knees should be slightly bent.
6. The ears should be over the shoulders.

This posture can be transferred to sitting and lying down

### Mixed Voice Belting [Video](https://youtu.be/Il7wN_7SSXA) Notes
- Belting
	- Chest Voice
		- Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons)
		- Tom Walker
		- Dave Groll (Foo Fighters)
	- Falsetto + Distortion (bratty, raspy)
		- Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin)
		- Axel Rose (Guns N' Roses)
	- Mixed Voice
		- Ed Sheeran
		- Bruno Mars
		- Beyonce
	- Coaching the technique
		- start with a thin layer of falsetto
		- blend in chest voice
			- use exercises to push up the mid-range voice - e.g., gee, mah, mum
			- focus on "ey" vowel in the word "take"
		- example at 5:37

### Head Voice [Video](https://youtu.be/zM2GDKDLr8s) Notes
- identify chest voice with speaking voice or a "hey" across street
- identify head with imitating owl, police siren or pet/baby talk voice

### Head vs Chest [Video](https://youtu.be/zM2GDKDLr8s) Notes
- Coaching
	- vowel sound across the whole range and identify when (?)

### Finding and Strengthening Male Chest Voice [Video](https://youtu.be/pfz2sdfP07A) Notes
- Head voice, like falsetto, is often more a nice color rather a style
- Machine Gun Kelley will pull his chest voice up higher than most people as a color
	- but doing that for most people may risk harm

---
### Eric exercises
- pre-session
	- hydration
		- start drinking water at least an hour before performance
		- avoid too much caffeine, alcohol, and ice cold drinks
		- use humidifier if it helps
	- neck and shoulder stretches and rolls
- warmup
	- discussion
		- ordinary male vocal range is ~2-3 octaves covering somewhere around C2-C5 (this is for someone who can sing bass, baritone, and tenor, but the world record is something like 5-6 octaves of range)
		- chest vs head 
			- chest (aka, "low resonance")
				- general speaking voice; "hey" like bad dog
				- biggest vibrations felt in the chest
				- described as having "dark," "warm," "full" tone
				- BUT its usage is limited as pitch increases and its overuse can impart a heavy or muffled quality
			- head (aka, "high resonance")
				- "hoo" like an owl
				- vibrations sometimes felt in cheeks, nose, or forehead (sometimes back of neck, sometimes difficult to notice other than reduction in chest vibrations)
				- described as having a "bright" or "light" quality and is easier to project
				- BUT its usage is limited as pitch decreases and it feels comparatively hollow
			- Movement
				- resonance is moved by shaping the spaces in your body
				- most people report feeling a "flip" as they sing across a pitch range that forces them transfer between these resonances (low -> high or high -> low), known as a "passagio"
			- (mixed, falsetto, fry) and passagio (flipping)
		- placement and vowels
				- specific muscles and body spaces (e.g., soft palate position, throat tension, vocal folds) control voice quality, but trying to manipulate them directly and deliberately is challenging.  Instead, their manipulation is taught in the form of "vowels" (which prioritize different muscles) and "placement" (imaginary positioning of the voice location or direction)
				- vowels
					- ah ("fawn")
					- eh ("felt")
					- ee ("feel")
					- oh ("foe")
					- oo ("food")
					- ng ("sing")
				- placement
					- forward
						- buzzing near the front of the face (lips, teeth, etc.)
						- achieves a clarity/brightness/projection that cuts through other noise
						- feel it in your nose and cheeks when you hum "ng"
					- back (aka, "covered")
						- feels deep in the throat or withdrawn
						- achieves "warmth"
						- feel it sitting deeper in your throat when you say "ah" in a yawning voice
			- start with closed, foward vowels (**ee** and **oo**) to find the high, forward resonance
					- prevent vowels from "sinking back into the throat"
					- use the "Singer's Smile" to open oral cavity and produce brighter sounds - lift eyebrows and cheeks
			- gradually move up more open vowels (**ah** and **oh**) as you warm up
			- descending (eh)
			- finish with the same pitch on each vowel (ah eh ee oh oo)
	- partially-occluded singing to minimize pressure difference across folds
		- lip trill, humming, buzzing, kazoo-ing, straw phonation
		- careful not to purse lips tightly or let air escape from the nose or sides of mouth
		- be sure its at least a quarter note time to be deliberate and knowing with tone and character
		- e.g., imperial march, full legato
	- 5-tone scales on mee, mah, and ng
	- breath
		- breathing
			- "belly breathing"/"sing from diaphragm"
			- lie down and place a book-like weight on stomach and raise it up for a few seconds at a time --> try to move it the same distance when standing
		- control ("support")
			- pretend to blow on a candle such that the flame tilts but doesn't flicker
	- "sighs" (?)
	- stretch/roll neck, jaw, and shoulders
	- nasality and the soft palette
		- nasality arises from predominant resonation in the nasal cavity  
		- feel the top back of your mouth with the thumb while you yawn or make a surprised inhaled gasp
		- exercise with a sustained 'ng' switching to an 'ah' and noting that all or none of either sound is blocked by holding your nose closed
			- once the sound is out of the nasal cavity, experiment with resonance/placement (Singgeek likes to push it further back for more pharynx than some people, producing a prominent vibration in her head,  and she considers the normal way to be too much oral cavity)
			- Pure oral cavity can sound like Kermit the frog, and deliberate face scrunching can help fix this
- learning
	- map out your voice
		- find lowest and highest pitch that you can hold a note
		- identify the "flip" spot between registers
- practice
	- siren from lowest to highest note

My range: 
- Low: F2
- Passagio: D#4 - F5
- High: C6

Here’s a varied list of **well-known voices** you can use as “targets” when practicing vocal resonance placement through impressions. I’ve grouped them by the dominant resonance they’re associated with, so you can experiment by imitating them and feel where the sound “sits” in your own body:
### **Nasal / Forward Placement**
- **Fran Drescher** (The Nanny) – exaggerated, nasal, instantly recognizable.
- **Jerry Seinfeld** – conversational, nasal with twang.
- **Gilbert Gottfried** – sharp, piercing nasal resonance.
- **SpongeBob SquarePants (Tom Kenny)** – bright, forward, youthful nasal quality.
### **Chest / Throaty Resonance**
- **James Earl Jones** – deep, rich, resonant in the chest.
- **Morgan Freeman** – warm, grounded resonance.
- **Vin Diesel** – gravelly, low chest placement.
- **John Goodman** – full, hearty, chesty tone.
### **Pharyngeal / Back Resonance**
- **Alan Rickman** – slow, dark, back-placed resonance.
- **Snagglepuss (Daws Butler)** – “exit, stage left” with wide pharyngeal quality.
- **Benedict Cumberbatch (as Smaug)** – cavernous, pharyngeal resonance.
- **Cher** – singing and speaking voice often sits in the back.
### **Laryngeal / Compressed Placement**
- **Mickey Mouse (Walt Disney/Wayne Allwine)** – high, tight laryngeal focus.
- **Kermit the Frog (Jim Henson)** – squeezed but warm laryngeal tone.
- **Michael Jackson** – airy, high-set placement.
- **Steve Buscemi** – slightly pinched, forward-laryngeal resonance.
### **Mixed / Unique Signatures**
- **Robin Williams** – agile, shifting placement across registers.
- **Christopher Walken** – unusual resonance with clipped phrasing.
- **Matthew McConaughey** – relaxed chest with nasal twang overlay.
- **Oprah Winfrey** – commanding chest resonance with forward brightness.
- **Patrick Stewart** – balanced pharyngeal + chest, highly resonant.
### **Cartoonish Extremes (Great for Play)**
- **Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta)** – chesty with nasal overtones.
- **Looney Tunes’ Elmer Fudd (Arthur Q. Bryan)** – forward, nasal, speech-quirked.
- **Stewie Griffin (Seth MacFarlane)** – pharyngeal + nasal hybrid.
- **Shaggy (Casey Kasem)** – throaty, slightly nasal, laid-back resonance.
