### 6/14 Notes
- Hammer's Gonna Fall
	- shortened intro to 8 bars (from 12)
	- spliced in profanity
	- adjusted levels (voice up, lead guitar down)
	- lowered reverb
	- fixed drums dropping out at the wrong point near the ending
	- added subtle soft clipping to voice 
	- exported basic MV
	- to-do
		- [ ] make vocal presence cut better through guitar (sounds ok at the end after the guitar cuts out)
