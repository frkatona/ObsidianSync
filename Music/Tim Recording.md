### 2025-09-25 Notes
- Start with vocal warmups
- Find range and passagio
- Go over song notes
	- Everybody's Looking
		- Re-sing to make it better without the obvious autotune sound
			- check to see how much could be brought back just from re-newtoning
		- Check the creative license on the drum parts and the bass motif aren't overstepping 
		- New takes are about as good vocally, but should present more/better tuning opportunities
	- Hammer's Gonna Fall
		- bring voice out more, make a little brighter
			- maybe duck the highs on the guitars with multiband
		- bar 33+, guitars sound a little out of sync
			- maybe again just for a sec at bar 81
		- maybe transition out of heavy drums a little smoother in the outro (bar 97)
		- tune up new version same as everybody's looking (make sure the gravely bit at the end of the new take makes it in)
	- Anger and a Prayer (new track)
		- 77 BPM seemed good, but kept drifting, so gonna come back to it another time and play (other song)
	- Citizen Beware (new track)
		- good track for head voice in the verses I thinkcv
		- guitar maybe a little out of sync at bar ~53, 57, very around 74 when guitar plays staccato
		- good power around 65 and 70
		- voice a bit lost at like 21-25, 28
		- 31 breathiness could be a bit more intimate, less unsure
		- life gets you down ~67 I wouldn't let the inflection droop
	- Ducks with Blood
		- mostly good I think, just some minor mixing notes for me
		- but I'd be interested to hear what Tim's belting voice sounds like if he wanted to try it here
- Sent out 

	- The War Ain't Over
		- forgot this existed until just now
	- C2 - A5 (~G3 passaggio, strong gravely floor)

### 2025-07-25
- Hammer's Gonna Fall mix fix
	- trying to bounce swear version ("vox2") with acoustics (no electric guitar except solo) for radio
	- added more highs/mids/stereo separation there for the real acoustic guitar
	- bumped guitar levels up a bunch, turned it down just a little for clear vox at low levels
	- [x] 1:10 (guitars sound out of time with each other)
	- [x] 1:45ish (fixed out of time guitars)

### 2025-06-27 Notes
- Lots of Ducks available
	- add a solo at 8-16 bar break (117?)
- inspiration bands ghost funk orchestra (walk like a motherfucker), bronco
---
### 2025-06-14 Notes
- Hammer's Gonna Fall
	- shortened intro to 8 bars (from 12)
	- spliced in profanity
	- adjusted levels (voice up, lead guitar down)
	- lowered reverb
	- fixed drums dropping out at the wrong point near the ending
	- added subtle soft clipping to voice 
	- exported basic MV
	- to-do
		- [ ] make vocal presence cut better through guitar (sounds ok at the end after the guitar cuts out)
