### 7/25
- Hammer's Gonna Fall mix fix
	- trying to bounce swear version ("vox2") with acoustics (no electric guitar except solo) for radio
	- added more highs/mids/stereo separation there for the real acoustic guitar
	- bumped guitar levels up a bunch, turned it down just a little for clear vox at low levels
	- [x] 1:10 (guitars sound out of time with each other)
	- [x] 1:45ish (fixed out of time guitars)

### 6/27 Notes
- Lots of Ducks available
	- add a solo at 8-16 bar break (117?)
- inspiration bands ghost funk orchestra (walk like a motherfucker), bronco
### 6/14 Notes
- Hammer's Gonna Fall
	- shortened intro to 8 bars (from 12)
	- spliced in profanity
	- adjusted levels (voice up, lead guitar down)
	- lowered reverb
	- fixed drums dropping out at the wrong point near the ending
	- added subtle soft clipping to voice 
	- exported basic MV
	- to-do
		- [ ] make vocal presence cut better through guitar (sounds ok at the end after the guitar cuts out)
