# Practice Notes

## 2025-09-26
 - Vocal warmups
	 - range: E2 to E4, head voice around C5 (or 6?), G5 downward passagio
	 - E4 passagio (voice cracking in Coverup)
		 - noticed as the high note in Coverup (they're so PROUD)
		 - it sounded painful the first few times, but then after a few iterations sounded strong, so it's attainable with some warming up
	 - walk away with some actual exercises
	 - "Anymore" in Hypno-state the "more" hits a C (4?) that isn't quite resonating enough to belt
 - Revolving Door
	 - piano will be played but I'll be using the keys for the intro
	 - finish rewriting A# to F# instead of vice versa
	 - Bb in the instrumental should a B
	 - Change first instrumental to 2x instead of 3x 
 - hypno-state
	 - wind down slow for the very last note
	 - instrumental corrections
		 - first line , the F-D transition is fast then hold the D until a C
			 - and it only goes through all that 2x (not 8x)
		 - second part is (2x) instead of (3x)
		 - The first sustained note in each prechorus lasts slightly longer than I expect (like 2.5 bars instead of 3?)

Thanks again for having me over for practice today!  As discussed, here's the setlist from my notes if you'd like to figure out your favorite order.  Remember it's just a 30 min set, so I'd imagine we'll be lucky to fit in 7
1) Revolving Door
2) Coverup
3) Hypnostate
4) Cliffhanger (Do Not Fall Away)
5) Landline
6) Pain Panic Worry and Woe
7) Atrium
8) Ragged

Also, (music portfolio website with Coverup)

Also, vocal notes on what we discussed, specific exercises, and reminder not to skimp on the basics (hydrate, stretch, etc.)
## 2025-09-21
- I think I mis-wrote the online Revolving Door notes: should be A# F#, not F# A# for the intro/verses
## 2025-09-06 Notes
- Voice training
	- Eric's voice was still hurting from a fire's smoke the night before, so both this and the recording was postponed
- Organized top 8 setlist candidates for our October Arena show
	- Revolving Door
	- Cover-up Song
	- Hypno-state
	- Cliffhanger
	- Landline
	- Pain, Panic, Worry, and Woe
	- Atrium
	- Ragged
- NEXT TIME
	- Voice training/exercises
	- Record Atrium for practicing (the only song of the 8 setlist songs not yet recorded on my phone)
