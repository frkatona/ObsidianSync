### 2026-02-15 Notes - Jam Day 1
- Theme: **"Strange Places"**
	- gameplay
		- can teleport but you are taken to another dimension (a la Minecraft nether rails)
		- "place" like "placement"
			- finding lost things (point-and-click adventure? 3D detective/mystery?)
			- finding things that don't fit where they are (puzzle)
		- "place" like "dwelling"
			- door-to-door ghostbusting in a neighborhood
	- environments
		- alien world (trees, fruit, space sky)
		- weird physics (superliminal, antichamber)
- Josh's ideas:
	- puzzling to figure out what that strange thing/place is
	- mechanics ideas:
		- exploration, open world type stuff (want to pay close attention to things and move around a lot to see new things..."make them want to pay attention")
		- games where you collect knowledge (e.g., chance of sendhar (?))
- Github actions to zip and push new builds to itch?
- Fleshing out game
	- open world, isolated foresty place where items are found in strange places; focus on visual interest, mystery, exploration
		- modern technology in a dated era?
		- traces of intelligence on an alien world?
	- 'look-at-me' mechanic:
		- staring directly at certain items cause them to light; persistent staring for a threshold of time causes light to swell and culminate into a 'press e to interact'
	- first 'look-at-me' is the bonfire
		- light or smoke from fire serves as a clear visual marker to orient the player as the move through an otherwise dense, disorienting terrain
	- enemies?  fight or run/hide?
