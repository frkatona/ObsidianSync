## What it's about
- how it came to focus on inoffensiveness and absence
## Why is it important/relevant
- broad
	- first American woman author
	- central to conversations about female american writers and american textbook authorships
	- who she influenced --> helps to understand them better
	- informs 'what it means to be an author in the period'
- direct
	- invites analysis of economic independence
