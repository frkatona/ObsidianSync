Theme: "**Constantly overworked**"

Ideas:
- elf present factory
	- present automation, a la factorio
	- impossible not to make some mistakes, have to optimize resources or hide mistakes from Santa (a la Papers Please)
- santa delivering presents overnight
- winter sale worker (cashier)
- signing christmas cards
- you're a mall santa
- driveway shoveling + salting
- christmas lights (rhythm game syncing songs to lightshow)

To-do
- figure out forge.squirrelracer login problems
	- josh is resetting password (but I could just upload to github for now anyway)

Settling on sokoban/cozy cafe thing (though maybe theme would be better to pivot to elf factory)

ask Josh to push build so I can try a deploy
