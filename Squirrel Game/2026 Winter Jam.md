Theme: "**Constantly overworked**"

Ideas:
- elf present factory
	- present automation, a la factorio
	- darker - impossible not to make some mistakes, have to prioritize resources and lie to Santa (a la Papers Please)
- santa delivering presents overnight
	- driving/flying the sleigh (racer with speedups, SM64 rings/coins), precarious rooftop landings
	- slippery rooftop walking, squeezing in chimney, stealthing past kids to tree, milk+cookies pickup
- winter resale worker (manager, cashier?)
- signing christmas cards
- mall santa (idk, visual novel-esque?)
- winter driveway maintenance (shoveling + salting)
	- simulation
		- visually satisfying 'particle wiping' brush effect
		- embodying the feelings of the shovel skidding along lightly dusted surface and of the sudden resistance when wet snow rapidly piles up
		- push space to toss over your back...hold duration = throw farther
	- snake-like (one snake for shove, other for salt, have to return for energizing cocoa)
- christmas lights (rhythm game syncing songs to lightshow)

Not-quite ideas:
- asdf

To-do
- figure out forge.squirrelracer login problems (codeberg?)
