### 2026-02-07 solo Miku animation notes
- got models re-topologized, re-normalized, re-textured
- rigging and animation challenge for a portable system: differences in hair/clothes
	- first idea: make base meta-rig and add bones which could work for any of the three models
		- remember NOT TO ANIMATE those extra bones so that there are no discrepancies in the animation data
		- [x] build test rig and animation and pull into Godot and try with spring bones ✅ 2026-02-07
		- [x] pull test rig/animation for one model into Godot and make sure (1) it's not broken by additional bones and (2) basic spring bones can be used effectively ✅ 2026-02-07
		- [ ] try again on same model but with all the bones that will be used for other hair styles
			- maybe I don't need to make one skeleton with each combination of hair bones
			- maybe instead just make a new skeleton for each and see if the new animations work
			- maybe try the bone retargeting option (advanced import settings -> skeleton 3D -> retarget (bone map))
		- [ ] try working bones on a different model and make sure that works
			- make sure the meshes are equivalent (do fingers line up?  how far back did I move the elbows?)
	- [ ] fix run animation (arms opposite legs)
	- [ ] fix the bone weights (probably lots of problems with arms in the hair or the smile/eyebrow mesh)
	- [ ] attach the hand items?  probably actually just export them to attach in Godot
	- [ ] make cool little backpacks or cloth capes
	- note to self: on first Overhauled_Yellow run cycle export, I had accidentally left in the tip of the hair lacking sufficient bone influence weight, and so the tip of the hair kinda stuck to the shoe in the Godot spring bone test.  If the 'fixed' hair seems to whip around too much, it's possible that intentionally leaving some tip vertices with sub-maximum influence could help solve that  
- IMPORTANT LESSON: only exporting deform bones seems to preserve the animations fine and removes the extraneous skeleton in the file (unclear on file size or processing difference)
	- realization from CoderNunk ([vid](https://youtu.be/OQhoZvYpXTs)) mentioning that metarig copies the original skeleton with 'def' prefix under the hood
	- he also mentions that "normalize position" and "retarget method" were the biggest for him
- Why is the hair bone chain shorter in Godot?  It seems fine but is still concerning
- after successful export, return to fixing music in the updated LD game

### 2026-01-26 Post-Jam and Kaya Websockets 
- 250702_gaemon_20frame
- still would prefer the miku ones, but ideally I can get those to translate animations between them (so build skeleton)
### 2026-01-22 Josh Winter Jam Meeting Notes
- pre-meeting thoughts:
	- anticipate role assignments and gaps/pain-points in our skillsets
	- build a tentative timeline
	- test-run version control
	- test-run deployment and updating with Butler
	- discuss scope (what's ideal, what's too far, e.g., 2D vs 3D, multiplayer)
	- making a mini project
		- probably just replicate a well-known game (e.g., vampire survivors, super mario, SM64, etc.)
		- building some universal backbone template
			- UI (pause menu, start menu)
			- logic (win screen, fail screen + restart menu)
- Meeting
	- josh feels his coding logic strengths lie in emergent behavior, he likes his tower defense history
		- **character controlling** is a weakness
	- jam starts at 8 tomorrow when I'll be at a show, but I can bring my laptop and shoot ideas when the theme is announced
	- timeline
		- Saturday 10:00 am - crystallize the vision
		- Saturday 4:00 pm - local playable version
		- Sunday 10:00 am - upload-ready final-ish draft, just final bug fixes
		- Sunday availability is before 1:00 PM and 5:00-~7:00 PM
	- try to sign into forge, coordinate with Josh a new branch push/pull/merge to troubleshoot conflicts
- Sokoban-style xmas delivery
	- pivot back to elves?
	- unlock or upgrade new paths or automate paths for the boxes to take as you progress
	- 
### 2026-01-19 Meeting Notes
- pre-meeting
	- acerola video (1/10, built all these things "crashed out")
	- godot 4.6 on release candidate
- code sprint share/talk
	- anime model
		- give walk/run/jump (etc.?) animations
		- re-do the skeleton to be able to reuse animations on all three
		- maybe clean up extraneous bones
	- Arana Grande
		- walk animation - added a third in-between state; animation now correctly only triggers on player input
	- Kaya recommends watching shows "scavengers reign" and "pantheon"
### 2026-01-12 Meeting Notes
- Josh dealt with some 401k stuff and comcast
- Kaya kept going with websockets multiplayer network synchronizer
- Ideas for neural network project
	- Kaya
		- hover over network lines to see weights 
	- Josh
		- train them in parallel
		- colony sim
	- idle game, ...

### 2026-01-09 Meeting Notes
- Kaya is pretty deep in rebuilding network sync from scratch with websockets, "probably head down for a few weeks," though it seems to be going well so far (she's well versed in websockets from previous projects compared to webRTC)
- maybe experiment with another jam game or two before diving back in
- ultimately will probably be me making the geometry and seeing if it works with code (e.g., pipes and other janky edge)
### 2025-12-08 Meeting Notes
- Kaya likes the "Space Krill for the Moon Whale" song
- talked about alternatives to the Arduino API's 'map()' function
	- just dividing, match, lerp, remap
	- purely as a tangent, Kaya talked about being reminded of monads
- Bryan came
	- he's making a cool little granular sand cellular automota thing inspired by his digging through mulch
	- talked about openwebui for his GPT credits
- Kaya talked about deriving utility from just rolling through the global scope functions ([here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_%40globalscope.html))

- ### 2025-11-17 Meeting Notes
	- to-do before
		- fishing / card updates (implement some slay the spire)
	- think on
		- prototyping hex tiles for Kaya's minigame

---
- ### 2025-11-10 Meeting Notes
	- Qs
		- resource saving in the second discord script
	- to-do before
		- use controls to distribute HandSlot nodes evenly
---
- ### 2025-10-28 Minigame Notes
	- think on fishing game as per Kaya's 10/28 message in the development channel
	- card game
		- fix
			- how to get a background box not interfere with the click
			- make only the top card clickable (can't click multiple cards at once)
				- or make them spawn further away from each other
		- distinguish between cards
			- e.g., assign number to center of the card's graphic
		- maintain state for the game (what  cards in what hand)
		- 
		- aesthetics
			- make card sprites animate
				- a pixelated character moves inside with other sprite frames?
				- animated gshader material?

---
- ### 2025-10-20 Meeting Notes
	- note to self:
		- ideas for squirrel mini games
			- work up fishing to something fancy
			- two players meet and high five to initiate competitive game:
				- invent a card game
		- tell Josh about Echoes of the Eye
		- talk to Kaya about Gimp
	- Kaya's webrtc thing isn't quite working on Windows to show and tell, but it's looking good on Mac and should just need a docker container and some setup script
---
- ### 2025-09-22 Meeting Notes
		- idea: pull video into DVR and use "Color Palette" mode to inform design
		- Anthony
			- messed with a few ways to make the roughness map glyph appear cool in Godot similar to Blender's Eevee, including SSR, reflection probe, and SDF-global illumination, but seemingly the best was to just add a small, colored spotlight at an angle next to the object
			- made a new candidate for creepy basement sounds by taking an orchestra-guitar piece I made, adding some Casette2 wow/flutter, and automating time stretch for like 10x its length
				- Kaya was interested in having that time manipulation happen in real time and so I should explore solutions for that including FMod
				- She also is just generally interested in FMod again, so maybe just pull it in either way
		- Talk about LD plans a little more
			- Josh still interested in joining, if only remote and if only for some of the weekend
			- Kaya will talk to Bryan about possibilities, but was open to coming over here, even if only for a day
		- To-do for next week and LD:
			- Dial in style more
				- Ucupaint 2.3.5 [1 min demo](https://youtu.be/bFvtmByQP3s)
				- Ucupaint biggger [moltenbolt tutorial](https://youtu.be/8_apXIn0g5w)

		- kaya says maybe there'll be git complaints, let her know if it happens (and then just put on drive)
	- Kaya
		- updated the basement flying blocks and tuned up a down-draft section behind the starting floor

---
- ### 2025-09-01 Meeting
	- shave the empty space off of fx in drive
	- think on how to 'side-chain' the music when near bonfire
	- wait on Kaya noting which sounds need a little tweak to be fully desirable
		- make the glide sample more loop-able (loop remainder)
			- or make separate initial sound + loop-able sound that doesn't have such a transient
			- maybe also other 'loop' tagged samples (loop reminder on the flre-lit-2_loop and also get it longer than 4 seconds)
