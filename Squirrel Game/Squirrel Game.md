- ### 2025-09-01 Meeting
	- shave the empty space off of fx in drive
	- think on how to 'side-chain' the music when near bonfire
	- wait on Kaya noting which sounds need a little tweak to be fully desireable
		- make the glide sample more loopable (loop remainder)
			- or make separate initial sound + loopable sound that doesn't have such a transient
			- maybe also other 'loop' tagged samples (loop reminder on the flre-lit-2_loop and also get it longer than 4 seconds)
 
 - ### 2025-06-03 Meeting
	 - To-do
		 - scatter blender objects (flora, buildings, etc.) in a terrain world
	 - Terrain notes (mostly [tutorial 2](https://youtu.be/YtiAI2F6Xkk))
		 - holes demo
		 - porting materials from libraries (e.g., ambientcg.com)
		 - painting wetness
		 -  bake occluder 3D (in 'Terrain3D Tools')
		 - flickering fix
		 - start with procedural noise (~19:30)
		 - vegetation placement techniques - manual, proton scatter, simple grass textured, "Asset Placer" (commercial)
