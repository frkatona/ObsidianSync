### 8/16 Notes
- filled most of list, removed flower grow (what sound is already there, do we want another, did I cover it in the bank already?)
- consider surface-dependent footsteps
- get autistic about file naming and structure (already modified in the GDrive)
	- prefix/suffix vs additional folders
		- prefix/suffix camelcase, etc.?
		- denoting one-shots vs loops, general music vs leitmotif, song start vs loop sections of that song
	- e.g., player movement currently is kinda like 'direct responses to player input' (except for UI), so it includes things like 'jump', but not 'rail grind' because that's an incidental and asynchronous response to input
	- maybe it's better separated into the sound origin
		- e.g., enemy would have sounds for it being hit as well as its environmental walking sound
		- e.g., player would have sounds like UI navigation, jumping, receive damage grunt, etc. with the player as the origin, regardless of the origin of the input
### 8/11 Notes
- Kaya new track assignment:
	- outside skybox
	- ambient for underground in voxel
	- transitioning stages (stage lietmotif?)
### 6/9 Notes
 - Kaya
	 - preferred to post basically any non-secret in one of the public channels going forward
	 - try pivoting squirrel's sfx to squirrel noises (a la SM64)
		 - chittering variations?  think on what other sounds squirrels might make
	 - [x] add actions to rail grind sfx
	 - [x] share github link to this checklist
