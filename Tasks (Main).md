Kaya notes
- this push and pull between the silence, even maybe like a minute or two between tracks (more sparse)
	- quirky minimalist vibe like undertale (in general) for most tracks in the game, but the voxel map should be very sparse
	- try for C418 tracks that are long and background (e.g., Mice on Venus, Living Mice) - and then don't have high energy for more than like 5-20s
