 - one slide on background (how we think through this)
	 - difficult to think through the isolated heat sources since we don't know what they are, so maybe don't allude too much (is JP doing his reflectance thing?)
	 - mostly important that heating and cooling is fast, we can get to high temps
 - one slide on the lasing conditions (chamber, laser) and before and shot for the actual sample
 - then JP probably will be the one with all the characterization slides, but we can send the first XRD on a third slide and let Mike sort it out

### 7/23 In-person meeting notes
- Asma had questions for Ben S about the structure of the compound
- Ben S points out that the PCD structure can be drawn with the vinyl group at the edge of the repeat unit, but also not, and it's unclear how that influences the simulation -- and Asma's units may have been missing a carbon
- Ben S uses ~50 ccpm for his Ar flow, which I should try to use for my new flow chamber 

### 7/21 Ultrafast Blackbody Thermometer Notes
- (2011) Ni, P.A. et al ["Multi-channel optical pyrometer for sub-nanosecond..."](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1016573)
	- pyrometer is just an absolutely calibrated spectrometer operating at several discrete wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regions which compares thermal radiation to temperature of the Planck formula
	- take into account all speed determining factors (modal dispersion of fibers, photodiode rise time, oscilloscope bandwidth)
		- but understand that all speed improvements will also lower sensitivity
	- Light Collection (LC) system
		- thermal emission collected by a relay system of lenses (pair of achromatic doubles, f=75 d=50.8 mm, coated for Vis/NIR) mounted on micro-positioning stage in a vacuum, oriented normal to the sample surface
		- produces a 1:1 image of the target on an optical fiber
		- lens focus/aperture chosen to match NA=0.2 = 24 degree acceptance angle; step-index, multimode, 400 um diameter silica fiber
		- asdf
	- Spectral resolution
		- asfd
	- Light detection (sensor)
		- Need broad frequency response current amplifier with a flat gain curve between the low cut (DC) and high cut (~GHz) frequencies
			- DC important since calibration is done with continuous radiation sources
		- PIN photo diode models 1591 and 1592 from Newfocus Inc ultimately chose
			- alternatives like (1) avalanche photodiodes (APD), (2) photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), and (3) micro-channel plates (MCPs) are considered to have a low-frequency cutoff from 10 kHz, making calibration difficult
			- also, avalanches and PMTs have high noise levels and saturate quickly; and PMTs and MCPs use phosphor which degrades over time and requires frequent recalibrations (and cost a lot per unit, which is untenable for a multi-channel detection system)

### 7/20 - Alex Presentation Notes
- Zoom presentation for updates on the design/synthesis of precursors for SiC photoceramization
- SiC is a good target for low-T photoceramization (well-represented both conventionally and with pre-ceramic precursors; also DOE considers it important)
- Two approaches to SiC photoceramization
	- "Decomposition Approach"
		- design precursor with defined Si:C stoichiometry and photodecompose (likely H2), leaving SiC behind
	- "Photocaging Approach"
		- design novel molecules bound to Si/C and photolyze to release SiC
	- Either way, long-term hope is for new synthetic chemistry and transferrable knowledge
- The "Decomposition Approach" is largely about getting the Si:C ratio right
	- Si is reluctant to form multiple bonds to other atoms, especially itself
	- Ideally, the designed material will be made entirely of Si and C, perhaps some H if necessary to terminate valency; Si:C will be 1:1 and/or tunable; must have a homolytic chromophore (Si-Si bond) 


### 7/18 Thor
- long/short ratio intermediate NIR solution for ultrafast blackbody thermometer
- Collect/transmit NIR light
	- hardware?  positioning?  ask Thor
		- OAP
		- Lens + fiber
- Split halfway into the detector range (~1250)
	- 1180nm longpass dichroic [DMLP1180](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=DMLP1180)  ($250) (variations for size) (see [graph](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=3313))
- Detector
	- Avalanche free space [InGaAs 850-1650 nm](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=APD310) (x2 = $6000)

	- Ordinary free space [InGaAs 800-1700 nm](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=DET08C/M#ad-image-0) (x2 = $700) (detector [main page](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7537))
- Filter below and above the sensors?
- Misc.
	- posts, mounts, rails, signal cable adapter to BNC
---
### 7/16
- Pre-meeting notes
	- PCD sample
		- Results from last one?
		- Any new sample?
	- Ask for Alex's presentation recording on the OneDrive
	- On-site
		- We're giving poster abstracts to the program manager before July 24th?  Give to Rob or email directly?
- Meeting Notes
	- Rob is still gone, so it's just me, Ben S, and Kavindi (later found out Tainara misunderstood Rob's email and thought the meeting was cancelled)
	- XRD was down, so no new results about anything
	- Ben S is emailing Rob asking about the poster abstract stuff (when? to whom? any special instructions?).  He'll let me know what he finds out.
	- Ben S giving me some more sample on sapphire to lase
		- He wants the same procedure as normal
		- Remember to document the process well, both in notes and in taking good photos/videos)
		- He scored it and cut the sample above it with a razor in an attempt to get a clean cross section, but the sapphire cracked into two slivers off the main body (pics taken on phone)
			- I'll try to put a little tape on them to prevent shattering if they crack from thermal shock, same as the last samples, which seemed to work well.
	- Ben S put the Alex talk link, so I should check to see if there are clues to what Alex wants specifically from me for his sample that I got in the mail (or what it is/if it's hazardous/needs stored in special conditions)

### 7/02
- (little bit of a repeat) JP built a TGA MS similar to what the MSC has
- H2 basically fully peaks before the methane begins to come off, reinforcing notion that H2 removal is a part of the mechanism
- to-do
	- get good pics/vids of before/after samples and the lasing process
### 6/26 Notes
- Paper notes
	- (2024) Horcher - Ceramic coatings from PDC (silazane + Al2O3/ZrO2) lasing
		- motivated by need for ceramic coating formation mechanism where heat does not penetrate to the substrate, permitting application of materials which cannot be exposed to corrosive environments, but are thermally sensitive (here, high strength-to-weight magnesium alloys)
			- first establishes disadvantages with alternatives:
				- electroplating and chromating deal with toxic chemicals
				- anodizing with hard oxide ceramic-like surfaces leads to porous coatings which are permeable to corrosive environments
				- organic coatings are limited in application temperature and are susceptible to mechanical damage
				- vapor deposition (CVD or PVD) are costly and limited by their complexity
			- PCDs are good (commonly poly-siloxanes, -silanes, -carbosilanes, and -silazanes)
				- suspensions can be applied to surfaces through simple methods like dipping, spraying, spin-coating, and doctor blade
				- drawback is high shrinkage (~50% volume) leading to pores/cracks increasing with thickness due to gaseous pyrolysis products

### 6/25 Notes
- Rob opening notes
	- on-site is on August 7th, get to program manager 24th of July, so we need abstracts from everyone who is presenting for the posters everyone else is presenting
- Ben S.
	- MS signals show propane and butane ion currents raised around 200 C
	- Rob - Check out broader source of papers on hydrogen release to get ideas for how to measure it better (H2 release as novel mechanism to precede ceramic transformation, particularly with photothermal)
	- DCM cast samples appear different from the previous samples which might impact the ellipsometry that JP's group will do, and so Ben will have to think on whether JP's group is ok with that before he gets me sample
		- Rob - "I think the cloudiness is a surface roughness thing because it's a homopolymer and homopolymers don't phase separate...maybe do an SEM of the film and see if it's porous...try holding cloudy samples at 75C in vacuum to anneal out the voids...maybe some kind of evaporation induced phase separation...interesting to consider if voids/pores play a role in photothermal absorption"
	- Tainara XRD indexing shows BSi and no graphite
		- Rob - "your silica should convert to quartz at these temperatures...that amorphous peak is throwing me off because everything (except for some carbon) should be crystalline at those temperatures)...try SAX and WAX"
### 6/18 Notes
- Asma slides
	- above 1150K, B10H14 --> B10H12 + H2 is spontaneous
	- barrier is ~150 kcal/mol forward, ~90 backward
	- experimental H2 barrier calculations would be highly valuable
- Ben S slides
	- TGA-MS shows H2 and CH3 largely coming off first at ~300 C, both losses largely leveling (maybe H2 goes up a bit at 600 C and drops down).  Ben L raises point that it's really hard to compare the H2 and CH3 quantitatively b/c of unknown ionization efficiencies 
- note to self
	- Find a k-type to test for Priya
	- Find photosensor (look up what accessible tech is highest response time)
	- email TJ 

### 6/11 Notes
- Ben S. GCMS H2 (m = 2) peaks start alongside the small molecule (m = 15) (2500-4000 s)
- JP - those boron species are highly reactive, "basically just jet fuel"
	- JP concerned about the distance between the TGA and MS
	- Pick up some thermally conductive tape to apply to sapphire
- Ben - might be better with Ar carrier gas instead of N2
- What was called B-H peaks evolving in FTIR approaching 1200 C (in Molecules 2018 23 2461) is dubious, lending weight to our skepticism of their proposed mechanism
- JP will measure optical loss (k) on sapphire samples prepared as consistent as possible to explore why it is that absorption seems so low yet we're producing so much heat
- Check into literature to see what we're doing differently
	- is our mechanism different, "do we need this mechanism we're proposing"

### 6/4 Notes
- GCMS doesn't show much change and there's some doubt about the veracity of the data considering the strangeness of various peaks
- Could we borrow Ray's H2 meter to sample the gases that come off (if a lot of H2 comes off, it reinforces the "H-removal --> reactive boron" mechanism)
- 'think about how many times you're hitting one spot etc.' ask Ben what other than the notes would be helpful
- misc neutron scattering thoughts from Rob
	- maybe think a bit about the impact on the pyrolyze-->infiltrate cycling repetitions
---
### 5/28 notes
 - characterization may pivot to Raman-AFM
 - MS plotting update reveals some H2, CH2 (or BH3), and C2H4 (or B2H4) release at 250 C oven treatment, corresponding to some simulations
---
### 5/1 notes
1. ‘Necessary to initiate that first step, release of the hydrogen’
2. Do the thermocouple experiment to see if there’s any exotherm that arises after the laser pulse (in excess of the energy of a pulse)
3. “What if we made thin boron films on graphite” (or B  with a polymer layer on top) + BC4 and laser both and see what exotherms and products result
4. ‘We can start thinking about boron-carbon phases that form’ (phase diagram)
5. Tainara + JP show a boron-rich phase is forming in XRD
6. Ben Stovall follows up that he suspects boron oxide based on his XRD
	1. Rob warns that the literature mislabels XRD indices routinely, so be careful
	2. JP warns that a certain splitting feature suggests something highly crystalline (likely substrate) and so they warn to get long reference scans for the slide next time
7. Rob warns we need to spend more money - only $650k out of a bunch more after the first year
	1. Real problem is when we spend the money but we’re late with invoices - be sure we are spending and invoicing or we could lose money
8. Tainara SEM
	1. Keep note of the duty cycle (pulse width/rest period) for future samples
	2. 20 kHz vs 200 kHz look pretty different - 200 kHz looks like a honeycomb, but do 
	3. How far does what size beam move during a single pulse
		1. Try just lasing one a single spot (no movement) to see if it accounts for the weird scarring patterns on the SEM images
		2. Try making the beam as big as possible and change the duty cycle at a single spot
		3. ‘Anything we can establish as a constant, we have to march through that parameter space’
		4. How can we get it to not move at all? Try at minimum speed when the beam size is big from being defocused (or lens expanded) so that it doesn’t move off the same spot
			1. Or just try the YAG which is static and big already
		5. Is there a way to get a single pulse (or just set such a high scan rate that you get a single dot at each point (make dotted lines to create a parameter grid of pulses vs energy densities)
9. Ben Stovall will give me samples which aren’t super uniform this week, but next week they will be and then we’ll do the parameter space for JP
	1. This week, we’ll give the samples to Tainara to cut into pieces herself
