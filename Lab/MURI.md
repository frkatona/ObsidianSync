### To-do
- Find out if we are retaining ligand from the polymer
	- [ ] run the white sample (no Boron) see what happens
		- recall that TGA shows polymer without boron degrades around 450, but around 250 with Boron
	- [x] bring it back on Sapphire for Tainara to cut
- [ ] Buy stuff before spending pauses around the 15th
	- [ ] O2 meter, appropriate thermocouple, better regulator
	- [ ] Thor stuff
- [x] Respond to GCMS email
- [ ] Get or take a desiccator downstairs
- [ ] Try forming gas

- [ ] Get FLIR images with or without wireless to report to Priya
- [ ] Email TJ about getting absorption for a given thickness at 532 and 1064 (what did Ben S say about it?)

### 6/4 Notes
- GCMS doesn't show much change and there's some doubt about the veracity of the data considering the strangeness of various peaks
- Could we borrow Ray's H2 meter to sample the gases that come off (if a lot of H2 comes off, it reinforces the "H-removal --> reactive boron" mechanism)
- 'think about how many times you're hitting one spot etc.' ask Ben what other than the notes would be helpful
- misc neutron scattering thoughts from Rob
	- maybe think a bit about the impact on the pyrolyze-->infiltrate cycling repetitions

### 5/28 notes
 - characterization may pivot to Raman-AFM
 - MS plotting update reveals some H2, CH2 (or BH3), and C2H4 (or B2H4) release at 250 C oven treatment, corresponding to some simulations

### 5/1 notes
1. ‘Necessary to initiate that first step, release of the hydrogen’
2. Do the thermocouple experiment to see if there’s any exotherm that arises after the laser pulse (in excess of the energy of a pulse)
3. “What if we made thin boron films on graphite” (or B  with a polymer layer on top) + BC4 and laser both and see what exotherms and products result
4. ‘We can start thinking about boron-carbon phases that form’ (phase diagram)
5. Tainara + JP show a boron-rich phase is forming in XRD
6. Ben Stovall follows up that he suspects boron oxide based on his XRD
	1. Rob warns that the literature mislabels XRD indices routinely, so be careful
	2. JP warns that a certain splitting feature suggests something highly crystalline (likely substrate) and so they warn to get long reference scans for the slide next time
7. Rob warns we need to spend more money - only $650k out of a bunch more after the first year
	1. Real problem is when we spend the money but we’re late with invoices - be sure we are spending and invoicing or we could lose money
8. Tainara SEM
	1. Keep note of the duty cycle (pulse width/rest period) for future samples
	2. 20 kHz vs 200 kHz look pretty different - 200 kHz looks like a honeycomb, but do 
	3. How far does what size beam move during a single pulse
		1. Try just lasing one a single spot (no movement) to see if it accounts for the weird scarring patterns on the SEM images
		2. Try making the beam as big as possible and change the duty cycle at a single spot
		    
		3. ‘Anything we can establish as a constant, we have to march through that parameter space’
		4. How can we get it to not move at all? Try at minimum speed when the beam size is big from being defocused (or lens expanded) so that it doesn’t move off the same spot
			1. Or just try the YAG which is static and big already
		5. Is there a way to get a single pulse (or just set such a high scan rate that you get a single dot at each point (make dotted lines to create a parameter grid of pulses vs energy densities)
9. Ben Stovall will give me samples which aren’t super uniform this week, but next week they will be and then we’ll do the parameter space for JP
	1. This week, we’ll give the samples to Tainara to cut into pieces herself
