- [ ] run the white sample (no Boron) see what happens (bring it back for Tainara to cut)
	- [ ] Q: are we retaining ligand from the polymer
		- [ ] TGA shows polymer without boron degrades around 450, but around 250 with Boron
	- [ ] Respond to GCMS email
- [ ] Put samples in vacuum desiccator
- [ ] Try forming gas
- [ ] send Yuki the MURI notes
- [ ] Buy stuff before Emma says spending is paused (when?)
	- [ ] O2 meter, appropriate thermocouple, better regulator
	- [ ] Thor stuff
- [ ] Get FLIR images with or without wireless to report to Priya
- [ ] Email TJ about getting absorption for a given thickness at 532 and 1064 (what did Ben S say about it?)

5/28 notes
 - characterization may pivot to Raman-AFM
 - MS plotting update reveals some H2, CH2 (or BH3), and C2H4 (or B2H4) release at 250 C oven treatment, corresponding to some simulations
