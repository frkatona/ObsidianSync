### 9/22 Yuki Practice
- Deadline 'sometime before December', wants to take it sometime in November
- Mechanism
	- Adri's idea that boron hydrides are used as hydrogen storage; here are boron hydrides...if I drove off these species, how reactive would the boron be...much more based on his calculation, releasing a ton of heat and carrying the reaction far enough

## Sandra toughness section phrasing

### Clarification of tensile load frame data
Here, we'll briefly clarify what tensile tests measure and how strength, toughness, and stiffness are determined.

Tensile property tests are conducted on tensile load frames.  These devices stretch sample material at a constant velocity, measuring both the stretched sample length and the load required to achieve the stretch at each time point.  When stress (the measured load as a fraction of the sample's cross-section area) is plotted as a function of strain (the measured length as a fraction of the original length), a 'stress-strain curve' is produced  This curve illustrates the distinct regimes of a material's failure and several useful mechanical properties can be ascertained from its analysis.

Briefly note the origin of the axis units:
 - stress is derived from load (N) over cross-section area (m^2), and thus is dimensionally similar to pressure, usually represented in Pa
 - strain—while it reflects the stretched length of the sample—represents that length as a fraction of its original length.  As a ratio of lengths, its units (m/m) are conventionally excluded from any properties derived from it

**Young's modulus of elasticity** (aka 'Young's modulus', aka 'stiffness') is a material's resistance to tensile elastic deformation.  In other words, it reflects the force required to stretch a material of a given thickness before it begins to sustain irreversible damage.  It is determined from the slope of the line found in this region and is represented most commonly in Pa (Eq. 1)

E = stress/strain

**Strength** is the maximum stress that a material can withstand before failure. In the context of a stress-strain curve, this is most often referred to as the **ultimate tensile strength**—the highest point on the curve. It represents the greatest stress a material can sustain, and thus shares units of Pa.

UTS = stress_max

**Toughness** is a measure of the amount of energy a material can absorb before breaking. On the stress-strain curve, it corresponds to the **area under the entire curve** up to the point of fracture. Toughness encompasses both the elastic and plastic deformation regions and is typically reported in units of energy per unit volume (e.g., J/m³). Materials that are both strong and ductile tend to have high toughness.

Together, these properties provide a comprehensive understanding of a material's ability to withstand stretching forces and its behavior under load, guiding material selection for engineering and research applications.
