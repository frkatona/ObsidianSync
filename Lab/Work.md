### Lab
- CB Properties paper proof
	- line 23: 2x 'widely'
	- line 79: 'different times'
	- line 109: typo 'glass slide slides' --> skis (fix typo but also clarify wording)
	- line 111: maybe add 'ordinary' to laboratory fluorescent lighting to clarify there's nothing special about the light source
	- line 116: typo - 'LOR' is unbolded
		- also, can a permutation be 'performed'? 
	- lines 160 and 162: phrasing 'single spot of' --> maybe preferred 'single position on' and 'single 3 cm-diameter circular exposure site'
