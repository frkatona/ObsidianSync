### 12/6 thoughts
- induction furnace with conductive carbon and metal particles
### Yuki Comps Notes (part 1) 
- p4
	- same slide title (probably intentional)
- p5
	- some animations might flow better grouped together
	- thin black border on images like these square ones would look nice
	- unclear why "no-field" is hyphenated
	- capitalization inconsistent
	- unclear if that final cracked icon that gets animated in is meant to appear last
- p6
	- I like how explicitly you establish how each problem is solved
- p10
	- in the slide title, I might choose a different word than "optimal."  It's the kind of word that gets committees in the mood to ask really abstract questions.  maybe something like "PCD is an attractive candidate for single-source B4C precursor"
- p13
	- I might ask why you chose to highlight that section of the temperature vs time graph.  It doesn't seem like it quite reached the baseline yet...is there something special about the curves at that time? 
	- I can't tell what the O2 icon is.  Are those little blue circles supposed to be electrons?  It's probably better to remove them if they're not conveying something helpful
	- the rest of the presentation seems to prefer the chemical formulae over full names like boron trioxide and boric acid
	- does it need to adsorb to the surface to react?  I figured it was more like...oxygen molecules in the air are constantly colliding with the PCD surface, but a reaction can only happen if there's enough kinetic energy...so if the PCD is hot while the O2 is colliding with it, it will form an oxide...but if the PCD transforms into an oxygen-stable product in such a short time that most nearby O2 molecules were still bouncing around, then maybe we don't need to worry about them.  
- p14
	- I think it's fine to ballpark a big temperature since we really don't know and we're deliberately being optimistic here, but I can't tell what 'n' is referring to, or where 1.78 cm2/s came from, or why we'd assume the diffusion layer thickness is 5 mm, or even what a "diffusion layer" is
	- I'm not sure what Chapman-Enskog Theory is for, but I would've started with a simpler approach (e.g., https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Physical_Chemistry_(LibreTexts)/27%3A_The_Kinetic_Theory_of_Gases/27.04%3A_The_Frequency_of_Collisions_with_a_Wall)
- p18
	- even in future work, be sure you're sufficiently motivating your experiments.  Lead with the gap and then fill the gap in.  So for this slide, for example, but sure to convey at the outset that (and probably why) there is a concern about substrates, why your method addresses it, and then how you intend to test it
- p19 
	- maybe strange that some of the most compelling data is in the 'future' section, but I would need to hear how you present it 
- p20
	- inconsistency in capitalization and font color
	- like in my slide 18 comment, I'll mention again to make sure when you present this that the 'gap' or practical concern is clearly conveyed before you mention what parameters you would be changing.  Again, I'll have to hear you present it, but I should be able to tell specially why I would care about a temperature vs penetration dial
- p22
	- this slide is called future work, but so is p17, and there are more slides later with the same name.  I would consolidate 'future work' together into one section
- p23
	- "gradient" and again make sure you lead with the gap
- p24
	- I still think periodicity will be a difficult sell.  Do you feel comfortable not only discussing what periodicity is and what that tell us about our product, but why that is important to us? 

### Yuki Comps Notes (part 2)
- p25
	- I'm still unsure why we care about uniformity (try to lead with a compelling motivation).  I'm also unsure what this data tells us about it—what does it matter if there is more more periodicity at the edges or in "protruding regions" or with differential "intensity"?
- p26
	- If any slide is named "future work", make sure no other slide is named "future work"
	- should something be in that green box?
	- I'm unsure what "perfect laser parameter" means, but "perfect" is another word that I would stay away from in front of a committee
	- I figured the reason we looked at periodicity already had something to do about uniformity, so why is that here?  And what about uniformity?  Are there not better ways to evaluate uniformity?  What are those ways and why is this better?
	- What does the bottom arrow mean?  What are the "protrusions" and do we want them removed or are we concerned that they are being removed?  
	- (I know I've said it an annoying number of times, but "lead with a compelling motivation" should be the first thing in your mind when setting up the narrative/structure/flow)
- p27
	- I like how you bring this slide back and how you animate in the darker layer
	- Do you really want to talk about these though?  Do you understand these systems (what makes them good candidates, especially such a weird system like a "bottle-brush grafted nanoparticle"?  what gap they're filling?  How similar/different their mechanisms of transformation might be?)
- p28
	- include figures, even if they're basic
	- what is recombining with carbon or boron?  the hydrogen?
	- What's happening to the boron while the hydrogen is busy forming H2?  Is it just vacant and negatively charged?
	- Do you know what the energies associated with these bonds being broken and formed are?  What is the total enthalpy of the process?  How much energy is in a laser pulse
	- Most importantly, why do you believe this?  What observations have you made?  And what other common possibilities from literature have you ruled out from those observations?
- p29
	- just like with "optimize" and "perfect," stay away from "proves" in favor of something like "supports" or "suggests" or "demonstrates"
	- Why does it matter if/when small hydrocarbons are releasing?  Does that not happen in other mechanisms?
	- Can you explain (or at least discuss) anywhere there is a peak or noise or doublet/triplet or anything that could reasonably be called a feature (or even noise) in each of these graphs?  
		- what is v3 and v4?  Why do some peaks seem to go below the baseline?
	- since the reaction you proposed has so many steps, why don't you see multiple features/peaks in your TGA?  And why is the weight loss so gradual?  Do you know the oven's ramp rate?  What is the relevance of the DTG peaking at like 250?  What's happening at 250 exactly?
	- Are the bottom graph and right graph supposed to be showing the same thing?  Is one just a reference?  If so, can you explain all the ways the graphs are different?
- p30
	- Why does it matter that hydrogen is being released early?  And the figure seems to suggest that the real important thing is that hydrogen is being released both early and late...so why is it doing that and why is that important to your mechanism?  
	- Why show an image of the TGA-MS, but not of the earlier instruments?
- p31
	- why do you care about the temperature?  What does it solve or how does it help us?
	- What are the common ways that researchers measure temperature, and why can we not just use those? 
	- What is a "dichroic beamsplitter tree"?  How does an "avalanche photodiode" work?  What are those triangle-with-a-line symbols in the illustration?  What do the colored rectangles represent?  
	- Why does the oscilloscope need to be 1 GHz?  What does it mean to "digitize" a signal (what does the analog signal look like and how does it get converted?)?  How do you plan on fitting to a blackbody?  
	- What temperature would the system need to be for the transformation to take place?

## Sandra toughness section phrasing

### Clarification of tensile load frame data
Here, we'll briefly clarify what tensile tests measure and how strength, toughness, and stiffness are determined.

Tensile property tests are conducted on tensile load frames.  These devices stretch sample material at a constant velocity, measuring both the stretched sample length and the load required to achieve the stretch at each time point.  When stress (the measured load as a fraction of the sample's cross-section area) is plotted as a function of strain (the measured length as a fraction of the original length), a 'stress-strain curve' is produced  This curve illustrates the distinct regimes of a material's failure and several useful mechanical properties can be ascertained from its analysis.

Briefly note the origin of the axis units:
 - stress is derived from load (N) over cross-section area (m^2), and thus is dimensionally similar to pressure, usually represented in Pa
 - strain—while it reflects the stretched length of the sample—represents that length as a fraction of its original length.  As a ratio of lengths, its units (m/m) are conventionally excluded from any properties derived from it

**Young's modulus of elasticity** (aka 'Young's modulus', aka 'stiffness') is a material's resistance to tensile elastic deformation.  In other words, it reflects the force required to stretch a material of a given thickness before it begins to sustain irreversible damage.  It is determined from the slope of the line found in this region and is represented most commonly in Pa (Eq. 1)

E = stress/strain

**Strength** is the maximum stress that a material can withstand before failure. In the context of a stress-strain curve, this is most often referred to as the **ultimate tensile strength**—the highest point on the curve. It represents the greatest stress a material can sustain, and thus shares units of Pa.

UTS = stress_max

**Toughness** is a measure of the amount of energy a material can absorb before breaking. On the stress-strain curve, it corresponds to the **area under the entire curve** up to the point of fracture. Toughness encompasses both the elastic and plastic deformation regions and is typically reported in units of energy per unit volume (e.g., J/m³). Materials that are both strong and ductile tend to have high toughness.

Together, these properties provide a comprehensive understanding of a material's ability to withstand stretching forces and its behavior under load, guiding material selection for engineering and research applications.
